# SkiFree HTML5 clone

A simple remake of the classic Microsoft game [SkiFree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkiFree) using JavaScript and the <canvas> tag.

This is a first attempt and I'm also experimenting with the Model JavaScript pattern so you'll have to excuse any mistakes. 

## TODO
* Clean up the code
* Add more entities
* Improve sprites
* Improve movement logic
* Add jumping
* Add restarting of the game
